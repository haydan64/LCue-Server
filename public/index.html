    <h1>Lcue Server</h1>
    <h2>Version 1.0.0<br>Created By Haydan Fisher</h2><br>
    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p>
        It's suggested to use this software on a private network separate from any POS or other essential systems.<br>
        This software can deeply integrate into devices on the network, including Home Assistant, Light boards, Video Devices, and other applicable devices.<br><br>
        It is also VERY recomended that every device on the network have a Static IP address, and/or a unchanging hostname.
